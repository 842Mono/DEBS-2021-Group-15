# Communication with the API

This code was provided by the competition website, I just configured the API key and tested it to make sure it works.

# Usage
I compiled this on Linux using the OpenJDK, I did `./gradlew build` and it generated some files. Run `build/install/bin/javaexample` to execute the program.

*This seems to be a bit more complex than what we want, I will take a look soon to see if we can simplify it down so we can better adapt it into the source layer on Flink*
