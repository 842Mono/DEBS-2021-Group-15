Query 1

Goal: return the top 50 cities by AQI improvement as well as their current AQIs.

For the current window, the latest event is watermark - 24hr

Use data over sliding window to calculate AQI1 and AQI2 using formula
Select the max of the two values as the AQI.

Computing improvement:
Every 5 minutes, a snapshot of the AQI of current year and AQI Of previous year are taken and inserted into a separate window

Current AQI average is time of snapshot - 5 days
Previous AQI average window is snapshot - 365 days - 5 days

Snapshots taken at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10, etc

At each snapshot, the max AQIp1 and AQIp2 of current and past year are taken from windows resized according to snapshot time

Current: snapshot time - 24 hours
Historic: snapshot time - 365D - 24hr

Once all measurements of batch are processed, results are summarized
Only active cities should be reported in result, so must have had a measurement received in the past 10 minutes.

Rank cities according to 5 day average AQI compared to previous year (derived from window sized relative to last measurement)

The current AQIp1 and AQIp2 are added per city

If less than 5 minutes of events… empty list expected as result
If not sensor is active…empty list expected as result
